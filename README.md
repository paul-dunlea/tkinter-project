# tkinter-project
this tkinter program provides a simple paint tool to create simple graphic. I developed this app using python and object-oriented programming. The application consists of two areas - a series of buttons and labels on the left hand side and a canvas graphics area on the right hand side. There is two groups of buttons. The first group of buttons should allow the user to select a fill colour - red, blue, yellow or green. The second group of buttons should allow a user to select a shape - a line,rectangle or oval. The two groups of buttons are put under their appropriate label which is colour or shape. Once the user has selected a colour and shape, they should be able to click on the canvas to define a corner and a second time to define a second (opposite corner) for drawing an oval or rectangle.
